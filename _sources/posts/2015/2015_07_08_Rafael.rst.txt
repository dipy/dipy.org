Hi all,

Just to report an issue that I am currently trying to figure out!

As I showed on my `previous post <https://dipy.org/posts/2015/2015_07_02_Rafael.html>`__ my first diffusion kurtosis reconstructions are looking very good. However when I try to process the Dipy's multi-shell dataset sample Sherbrooke 3 shells, kurtosis measures seem to be widely corrupted by implausible high negative values see figure below:
