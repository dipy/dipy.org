Hello everyone,
I am back with another update on my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) journey with DIPY. The Community Bonding period has come to an end, and I am now fully immersed in the Coding phase of the project.

Progress So Far
---------------

Last week I updated my PR with required functionality for it to be ready to be integrated. I was having trouble with CI(Continuous Integration) pipeline in Github, I reached out to the whole team in GSOC and received support immediately,
I am really grateful to `IÃ±igo Tellaetxe <https://github.com/itellaetxe>`__ and my mentor `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`__ for providing me necessary insights to fix the issue with CI.
I also put up another very small PR to fix the codespell issues happening in the CI. 

Expanding the Decorator Implementation
--------------------------------------

Building upon the foundation laid during the Community Bonding period, I have been looking into the expansion of the decorator implementation across more modules in DIPY.
I have gone through the required functions and tests. I will have to plan which modules are next for change with my mentor.
I will write comprehensive tests in this part as well. Also will be updating the necessary documentation as well.

Refining Decorator Implementation
---------------------------------

I will continue to refine the decorator implementation based on feedback from the community and my mentor. This includes fixing any bugs, improving performance, and enhancing the documentation further.

Lazy Loading Integration
------------------------

In addition to expanding the decorator implementation, I have begun researching for Task 2, which involves integrating lazy loading into DIPY. Lazy loading is a design pattern that can help improve the efficiency and performance of the codebase by delaying the initialization of objects until they are actually needed.
I will begin this task when my mentor will advise me to.

Community Engagement
--------------------

Staying engaged with the DIPY community is crucial. I will try to participate in discussions, seek feedback, and collaborate with other contributors to ensure the success of the project.

Final Thoughts
--------------

The first week of the Coding phase has been incredibly productive, and I am excited about the progress I have made so far. The support and guidance from my mentor and the community have been invaluable, and I am looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to work on enhancing DIPY!

Thank you for reading!
