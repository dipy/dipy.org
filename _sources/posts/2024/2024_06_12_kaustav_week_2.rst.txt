Greetings, everyone!
It's time for another update on my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) journey with DIPY. The second week of the Coding phase has been equally productive and exciting, with significant advancements in both tasks.

Decorator Function Refinement
-----------------------------

Building upon the initial implementation from the previous week, I have invested significant efforts in refining and correcting the decorator function.
With the guidance of my mentor, `Serge Koudoro <https://github.com/skoudoro>`__, I have meticulously reviewed the code, identified areas for improvement, and made necessary changes to enhance its performance, readability, and maintainability.

Comprehensive Testing and Bug Fixing
------------------------------------

Alongside the refinement process, I have written comprehensive tests to ensure the decorator function's robustness and reliability.
These tests have been instrumental in identifying and resolving bugs, allowing me to thoroughly validate the decorator's functionality across various scenarios and cases.


Difficulties & Challenges
-------------------------

I didn't face any particular difficulty with my task this week, as it was pretty straightforward. I just had concerns about how the versioning would work out but I made proper test case scenarios for that as well.

Documentation Updates
---------------------

To ensure the long-term maintainability and usability of the decorator, I have updated the necessary documentation with Numpy standard.
This includes clear explanations of the decorator's functionality, guidelines for its usage, and examples to assist other contributors and users in leveraging its capabilities effectively.

Lazy Loading Research
---------------------

In addition to decorators, I looked and tested some implementations of lazy loading in some libraries.
1. Scipy
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib

Next Week
---------

The plan next week is to implement decorator functions to all modules in DIPY and put up PRs. My main PR at the moment is https://github.com/dipy/dipy/pull/3239 .

Final Thoughts
--------------

The second week of the Coding phase has been dedicated to refining and correcting the decorator function, laying a solid foundation for its seamless integration into DIPY's codebase. 

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to work on enhancing DIPY!

Thank you for reading!
